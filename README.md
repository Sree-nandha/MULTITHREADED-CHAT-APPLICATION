# MULTITHREADED-CHAT-APPLICATION

*COMPANY*:CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*:SREENANDHA K

*INTERN ID*:CT04DG2749

*DOMAIN*:JAVA PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*:4 WEEKS(25 JUNE 2025-25 JULY 2025)

*MENTOR*:NEELA SANTHOSH

*DESCRIPTION OF TASK*: This project is a Multithreaded Client-Server Chat Application built using Java Sockets and Multithreading, designed to facilitate real-time text communication between multiple clients over a network.

The application includes:

A server that listens for client connections and manages message broadcasting.

Multiple clients that can send and receive messages concurrently.

Use of multithreading to handle each client on a separate thread, ensuring scalability and uninterrupted communication.

The chat server supports simultaneous client connections, and messages sent by any client are broadcast to all other connected users.

*TASK OVERVIEW*: The objective of this task is to design and implement a Multithreaded Chat Application using Java Sockets and Multithreading. The goal is to simulate a real-time messaging environment where multiple clients can communicate simultaneously through a central server.

This application demonstrates:

Socket Programming for establishing client-server communication.

Multithreading to handle multiple users concurrently without blocking.

Message Broadcasting to allow all connected clients to receive messages from one another.

This project aligns with industry-level expectations for basic real-time systems, and is suitable for internship-level training in Java Networking, Concurrency, and System Design Basics.

*TOOLS USED*: Java SE

Java Sockets (TCP/IP)

Multithreading

Eclipse IDE

*TECHNOLOGIES USED*:  This project was developed using Java SE as the core programming language. The application leverages Java Sockets (TCP/IP) to establish reliable communication between the server and multiple clients. To handle concurrent client connections efficiently, multithreading was implemented on the server side. Development and execution were carried out using the Eclipse IDE, providing a structured environment for managing code and debugging. The user interface is console-based, utilizing standard input/output streams to send and receive messages in real time. The system is built on top of the TCP/IP protocol, ensuring stable and bidirectional communication across the network.
